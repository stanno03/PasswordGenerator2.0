# JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description:

The password generator takes in user input and provides a randomly generated password. The user can choose between 8-128 characters, lowercase, uppercase, special characters and numeric characters. The application is browser based and uses window.prompt(), window.alert() and window.confirm() to allow the user to input the amount of chars required and also the requirements for specific characters. The generated password is then displayed using window.alert().
